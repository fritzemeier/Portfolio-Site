        <h1 id="CPTC">Regional CPTC</h1>
        <p>
          On October 6<sup>th</sup>, 2018, our team took home first place at the CPTC Central Regionals. November 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2018, we
          will be travelling to Rochester, NY, for finals.
        </p>
        <h3>What is CPTC?</h3>
        <p>
          CPTC provides a realistic baseline for a professional pentest.  Members of the CPTC committee, also known as the white team in competition, create an internal network of a hypothetical company.  
          During the competition hours, competing teams (usually state universities) are provided with the resources (laptops, etc) to connect to the network.  
          Using these resources, they must conduct enumeration and vulnerability assessments on the services and hosts within the network, all while 
          allowing the services to continue running as normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          When communicating with white team, competitors must act "in character" as a professional contractor. Occasionally, a competitor may have to 
          commit to tasks from the company called injects.  An example of an inject may be presenting on a type of threat to the company and providing 
          technical or software solutions to the possible threat.
        </p>
        <p>
          A competitor will find that the assessment may range from finding every vulnerability possible to only enumerating small and unexploitable items.  
          No matter the findings, the team creates a report after the competition to document what has been found in terms suitable for the every day person.  
          Although the report should be readable to a person of any technical skill level, the team asserts the importance of each item within the report.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>The Takeaway</h3>
          So far, my experience with CPTC consists of learning about professionalism within the field and the importance of thinking outside the box.  
          Originally, my goal when approaching a vulnerable host was to try to breach and escalate as quick as possible.  Instead, I was confronted with 
          the reality that a host may not always be vulnerable, so enumerating as much information as possible is important.  Even finding a deprecated 
          version of encryption could be worthwhile to point out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I might just take a technical writing class for good measure.

        <h1 id="CCDC">DSU Mock CCDC</h1>
        <p>
          DSU held the first mock competition of 2018's fall semester on September 23<sup>rd</sup>, in which I participated as a red-team member (attacker).
          Students who participate on a blue team often come out with a better understanding of what a secure network should entail.  Red team
          simulates attackers attempting to gain access, implement persistence and eventually take services offline.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, I've worked as a white-team member and helped set up the mock competition environments to understand the connectivity of a domain.  
          During the competition where I was on the white team, I assisted in a few injects by introducing them and sometimes scoring the response from each team.  
          No matter what team, a student has the opportunity to gain foothold in understanding security, networking, and professionalism.
