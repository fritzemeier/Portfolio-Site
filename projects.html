          <h1 id="RPiSMS">Raspberry Pi SMS Command Execution</h1>
          <p>
              In March of 2018, I began to look into automation using a Raspberry Pi. This began an in-depth learning experience of Linux alongside a bit of Python programming
              and editing bits of JavaScript code from two other projects on GitHub.  I also learned how to create and delete scheduled Cron jobs via Python and dump information
              about the execution into a log of its own.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/fritzemeier/RPiNodeCafe">Here</a> is the current state and culmination of the project. Still a work-in-progress.
          </p>
          <p>
              In my <a href="https://github.com/fritzemeier/RPiCafeLogging"></a>first venture to complete this task, I began to search for a way to send keywords or commands via SMS
              messages (text messages) to my Raspberry Pi, parsing them for possible security risks such as the sender of the message and their intentions, then executing ones that
              may be deemed acceptable.  I found that the pygooglevoice module would be fitting.  Instead of having to purchase a GSM capable USB or some other expensive solution,
              pygooglevoice provided the ability to view, delete, and send SMS messages directly from the command line.  The original project was ditched by its creators a few years
              prior, so I found <a href="https://github.com/pettazz/pygooglevoice">a GitHub project by pettazz</a> which was also a bit out-of-date, yet actually worked. I ended up
              modifying one of the examply Python programs provided within the project which parsed the SMS into a Python list, of which contained sender info and message body.  I
              ended up taking the returned messages, checking the sender, searching the message for a specific keyword or sets of keywords, and then executing the corresponding
              function. My chosen options for functions became "schedule," "execute," and "cancel" because the initial objective with the Pi was to interact with a coffee maker,
              allowing me to start or schedule coffee at my discretion by simply sending a text message.
          </p>
          <p>
              Once I felt my RPi SMS project was functional enough simply logging the executions (about 7 months later), I purchased a pair of
              <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonoff-Electrical-Household-Appliances-Compatible/dp/B074N22WFT/ref=pd_sim_60_3?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B074N22WFT&pd_rd_r=a223bce3-d3e6-11e8-bb24-b147f0633e7b&pd_rd_w=zhcdZ&pd_rd_wg=RVG6g&pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=18bb0b78-4200-49b9-ac91-f141d61a1780&pf_rd_r=17CQACDDJHZ1P6QV4RM6&pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_t=40701&psc=1&refRID=17CQACDDJHZ1P6QV4RM6">
              Sonoff Basic WiFi switches</a>, simply put: a relay with an ESP8266 WiFi capable chip, which was supposed to be a simple solution versus using the Raspbery Pi with a
              relay attached to the GPIO pins next to my kitchen sink.  If the Pi is positioned where I cannot leave a keyboard and monitor nearby in fear of water damage, My skin
              would crawl. So, the WiFi switch seemed reasonable. However, it came with a few interesting issues.  The Switch comes with out-of-date firmware. This may sound like a
              risk to the everyday user, but, as it turns out, the default firmware is capable of communicating with a server on the same network, enabling HTTP/S interactions with
              the switch.  I learned this the hard way when I updated the first Switch I took out of the box.  Thankfully, I swapped the first one for much simpler usage than what I 
              originally wanted, such as a desk lamp or fan.  Thankfully, I bought two.
          </p>
          <p>
              After learning my lesson with the first Switch, I made sure to keep the second one downgraded for the sake of the project.  My next step was to set up a NodeJS server
              hosted by the Raspberry Pi which would allow communication to the Switch simply by making HTTP/S requests with the correct parameters.  Another GitHub project, mdopp's
              <a href="https://github.com/mdopp/simple-sonoff-server">simple-sonoff-server</a> provided the functionality and simplicity I desired.  Because of poor documentation
              as well as my lack of experience with NodeJS/servers in general, I had difficulty understanding the correct sequence of events and devices needed to initiate the process. 
              Especially for Raspberry Pi's it seemed a bit complicated; however, I finally worked it out as such:
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Devices Needed:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>One device hosting the NodeJS server</li>
            <li>A separate WiFi capable device to make <code>wget</code> requests (I used a laptop booting from a live Linux USB)</li>
            <li>One Sonoff Basic WiFi Switch correctly spliced into an extension cord or power cord of your liking.</em></li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <h3>The Process:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Add the correct configuration for your network in the <code>sonoff.config.json</code> file.</li>
            <li>Reconfigure <code>var express = require('body-parser')</code> within <code>sonoff.server.js</code> to point to the correct file in the directory.</li>
              <div id="hanging">I found it under <code>[PATH TO PARENT DIRECTORY]/simple-sonoff-server/node_modules/express/node_modules/body-parser</code>.</div>
            <li>Some other possible misconfigurations, I cannot recall if any more were necessary, but just in case.</code>.</li>
            <li>Start NodeJS by running <code>node sonoff.server.js</code> on the designated server.</li>
            <li>Plug the male end of the spliced cord into an outlet. With everything in working order, a green LED should start blinking.</li>
            <li>Hold down the button on the Sonoff Switch for 5 seconds. The LED should start blinking as the device enters AP mode.</li>
            <li>Use the WiFi capable device to connect to the device's network advertised as ITEAD-10000xxxxx (each x standing for some arbitrary character).  The default password 
              should be 12345678. THE SWITCH DROPS OUT OF AP MODE AFTER A FEW MINUTES, DO THE NEXT STEP BEFORE IT DOES.</li>
            <li>Send network configuration data via the POST method to the device:</li>
            <div class="codebox"><code>wget -O- --post-data='{"version":4,"ssid":"yourSSID","password":"yourSSID_PASSWORD","serverName":"n.n.n.n","port":1081}' --header=Content-Type:application/json "http://10.10.7.1/ap"</code></div>
            <li>If connected to the device and the configuration data accepted, the device should send a response to the WiFi device.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            After all of the above is said and done simple GET requests to the server will change the state of the device.
            <ul>
              <li><code>/devices</code> => list off all devices that are currently known to the server.</li>
              <li><code>/devices/:deviceId/status</code> => shows the status of the device</li>
              <li><code>/devices/:deviceId/on</code> => turns the device "on"</li>
              <li><code>/devices/:deviceId/off</code> => turns the device "off"</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            Shortly after I purchased the WiFi switches, I found out the new version of iOS (version 12) brought along a native iPhone app called <em>Shortcuts</em>.  My emotions were 
            split. A part of me was relieved as much as grateful that Apple had finally introduced SSH, web requests, and some scripting functionality into their OS. The other was slightly
            frustrated that I had went through a bunch of trouble to set up a SMS system in the first place now that it was rendered somewhat moot.  Thankfully, I may still be able to 
            adjust the repo so that I may text and execute any command on the Pi rather than using SSH.  That would be if pygooglevoice hadn't started giving me troubles. Hopefully this 
            is all still working correctly...
          </p>
          <h3>TL;DR</h3>
          <p>
            I programmed a SMS system to try and run a relay because getting up in the morning is hard.
